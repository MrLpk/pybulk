Using this token
To use this API token:

Set your username to __token__
Set your password to the token value, including the pypi- prefix
For example, if you are using Twine to upload multiple projects to PyPI, you can set up your $HOME/.pypirc file like this:

[distutils]
  index-servers =
    pypi
    PROJECT_NAME

[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = # either a user-scoped token or a project-scoped token you want to set as the default

[PROJECT_NAME]
  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = __token__
  password = # a project token 
You can then use twine --repository PROJECT_NAME to switch to the correct token when uploading to PyPI.

For further instructions on how to use this token, visit the PyPI help page.
